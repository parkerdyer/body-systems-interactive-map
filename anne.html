While she was never diagnosed with actually having a heart attack, some opioid analgesics, including morphine and meperidine, have been associated with a small increased risk of myocardial infarction or heart attack. The risk of heart attack was also found to be increased in patients who were taking multiple opioid analgesics at one time, as Anne was doing.",

People taking opioid analgesics will often complain of nausea, vomiting, and constipation. These symptoms are caused by several mechanisms. Opioid analgesics increase the amount of time it takes for food to pass through the stomach, leaving a feeling of fullness long after meals. Slower digestion can lead to constipation. Opioid analgesics can also have a direct effect on the vomiting center of the brain. In Anne’s case, the opioid analgesics she took caused extreme difficulties with constipation.",

Since hormones have a role in weight control in addition to bone and muscle health, Anne’s risk of weakness increased resulting in multiple falls around her house. Decreased bone and muscle health placed her at a higher risk of not only falls, but also bone fractures.",

Most of her days were spent reclining in a chair at home to the point that her muscles became weak and her overall endurance declined. Beyond the resultant inactivity, opioid analgesics affect the body’s hormones and can further negatively affect muscle mass and strength.",

          "description": "The central nervous system, made up of the brain and spinal cord, is particularly vulnerable to the effects of opioid analgesics. For instance, opioid analgesics have been found to increase the likelihood of either developing depression or further worsening preexisting depression. Depression is often, unfortunately, accompanied by social isolation and sleep disturbances, either insomnia or excessive daytime sleepiness. One physician’s examination of Anne revealed that, \"her speech was slurred and it was hard to keep her awake to carry on a conversation.\" Furthermore, opioid analgesics have the potential to over-sensitize the brain, leading to a condition where patients have actually had increased amounts of pain. This condition is called opioid-induced hyperalgesia. Finally, we cannot forget about the risks of dependence and addiction that frequently accompany opioid analgesic use.",

Women, for instance, are more prone to menstrual irregularities and carry a two-times higher risk of having children with birth defects. Men and women are both at higher risk for sexual dysfunction and problems with intimacy.",

Opioid analgesics decrease the brain’s ability to sense high levels of carbon dioxide in the blood and also diminish the amount of air breathed in by the lungs. This is the most common way that people die from opioid overdose — their breathing slows down, their breathing stops and they ultimately suffocate.",

That is, older bone tissue is broken down and stronger bone tissue is formed, resulting in stronger bones. Opioid analgesics have been found not only to impair this process by having a direct effect on bone-generating cells, called osteoblasts, but also negatively affect the hormones of the body that help regulate bone growth. Anne’s cognition was significantly impaired by her medications, causing her to fall multiple times. While she did not directly sustain any fractures, she was at a much higher risk for bone injury as a result of the opioid analgesics being taken.",

She had developed a condition called urinary retention or failure to completely empty her bladder. Opioid analgesics can decrease the sensation of a full bladder by limiting the amount of discomfort that is noticed. They can also cause increased resistance to urine flow out of the bladder. Both situations, as well as more complicated spinal cord involvement, can result in urinary retention that, when left untreated for long periods of time, can contribute to urinary tract infections and kidney damage.",
